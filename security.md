# Pawsitive Strides Security Analysis Report

This report details potential security vulnerabilities and concerns identified through an analysis of the project's JavaScript and HTML files as of [Current Date - Please Replace].

**Disclaimer:** This is an automated analysis based on the provided code snippets. It does not replace a thorough manual security audit or penetration test. The actual security posture heavily depends on server-side configurations, Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and deployment environment settings not visible in this analysis.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Exposed Supabase Anon Key & Reliance on RLS

*   **Files:** `src/js/common.js`
*   **Finding:** The Supabase URL (`SUPABASE_URL`) and Anonymous Key (`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) are hardcoded directly in client-side JavaScript.
*   **Risk:** While the Anon key is *intended* to be public for anonymous access scenarios, this configuration makes the **entire security of the database reliant on correctly implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies** within Supabase. Weak, misconfigured, or missing RLS policies could allow any user with this easily obtainable key to read, modify, or delete data they should not have access to.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Conduct a thorough review and rigorous testing of **all** Supabase Row Level Security policies for every table (`profiles`, `dogs`, etc.).
    *   Ensure policies strictly enforce the principle of least privilege for both anonymous and authenticated users based on `auth.uid()` and user roles.
    *   Specifically verify policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.
    *   Consider using Supabase Edge Functions for operations requiring complex authorization logic beyond RLS capabilities.

## High Priority Findings

### 2. Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input

*   **Files:** `src/js/login.js`, `src/js/signup.js`, `src/js/profile.js`, `src/html/*.html` (where JS manipulates DOM)
*   **Finding:** User-provided data fetched from Supabase or entered into forms (e.g., names, addresses, dog details, walker profiles, error messages) appears to be inserted directly into the HTML DOM, often using `.innerHTML` or framework equivalents, without consistent sanitization.
*   **Risk:** Malicious users could potentially inject script tags or HTML event handlers (`<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`) into data fields. When this data is displayed to other users (or the same user), the scripts could execute in their browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Implement Robust Input Sanitization:** Before rendering *any* user-controlled content in the HTML:
        *   Prefer using `.textContent` over `.innerHTML` whenever possible to treat data as plain text.
        *   If HTML rendering is necessary (e.g., for rich text), use a well-vetted HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify) to strip out potentially dangerous tags and attributes.
    *   Sanitize data both on the client-side before display *and* ideally on the server-side/within Supabase before storage (defense-in-depth).
    *   Never reflect raw error messages from Supabase directly into the HTML (see Point 4).

### 3. Exposed & Unrestricted Google Maps API Key

*   **File:** `src/html/profile.html`
*   **Finding:** The Google Maps JavaScript API key is hardcoded directly in the `<script>` tag's `src` URL within the HTML. The key appears to lack restrictions.
*   **Risk:** Exposing the API key client-side is necessary for the Maps JavaScript API, but an *unrestricted* key can be copied and used by anyone on any website. This can lead to quota exhaustion, unexpected charges on your Google Cloud account, and potential abuse.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Restrict the API Key:** In the Google Cloud Console:
        *   Apply **HTTP Referrer restrictions**, allowing the key to be used *only* from your application's specific domain(s).
        *   Apply **API restrictions**, limiting the key to *only* the necessary Google Maps APIs (e.g., Maps JavaScript API, Geocoding API, Places API).

## Medium Priority Findings

### 4. Missing Content Security Policy (CSP)

*   **Files:** `src/html/*.html`
*   **Finding:** No `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag or HTTP header is defined.
*   **Risk:** Lack of CSP makes the application more susceptible to XSS and data injection attacks. It removes a significant layer of defense that instructs the browser on trusted sources for scripts, styles, images, etc.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Implement a strong `Content-Security-Policy` via HTTP headers (preferred method).
    *   Start with a restrictive policy (e.g., `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://maps.googleapis.com; style-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https://images.unsplash.com; connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co wss://*.supabase.co https://maps.googleapis.com; frame-src https://maps.googleapis.com; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self';`) and refine it.
    *   Aim to remove `'unsafe-inline'` from `style-src` by refactoring inline styles or using nonces/hashes. If inline scripts are kept (e.g., Google Maps init), use nonces/hashes via `script-src`.

### 5. Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI) Attributes

*   **Files:** `src/html/*.html`
*   **Finding:** `<script>` and `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags loading resources from CDNs (Tailwind, Supabase) lack the `integrity` attribute.
*   **Risk:** If the CDN provider is compromised or serves a modified file, the browser will load and execute the potentially malicious code without verification.
*   **Recommendation:** Add the `integrity` attribute with the correct file hash to all external resources loaded from CDNs. Obtain the hash from the CDN provider or generate it yourself. Also include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute.
    *   Example: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2" integrity="sha384-..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`

### 6. Potential Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

*   **File:** `src/js/profile.js` (e.g., `handleRemoveDogClick`)
*   **Finding:** Operations like deleting a dog seem to rely primarily on the object's ID passed from the client, likely assuming RLS will enforce ownership.
*   **Risk:** If the corresponding Supabase RLS policy for `DELETE` on the `dogs` table is missing or incorrectly configured (e.g., doesn't check `auth.uid() == owner_id`), an authenticated user could potentially craft a request to delete dogs belonging to other users by guessing or obtaining their dog IDs.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   **Verify RLS Policies:** Double-check and test the RLS policy for `DELETE` on the `dogs` table (and similar operations on other tables) to ensure it strictly enforces ownership (`USING (auth.uid() = owner_id)`).
    *   Consider adding explicit ownership checks within Supabase Functions if logic becomes complex, though strong RLS is often sufficient.

### 7. Raw Error Message Exposure

*   **Files:** `src/js/login.js`, `src/js/signup.js`, `src/js/profile.js`
*   **Finding:** Some client-side error handling code directly embeds `error.message` from Supabase into user-facing error displays.
*   **Risk:** Exposing raw backend error messages can leak internal system details (potentially useful to attackers) and provide a poor user experience.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Catch specific anticipated errors (e.g., invalid credentials, email exists) and show generic, user-friendly messages.
    *   For unexpected errors, display a generic error message to the user (e.g., "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.") and log the detailed `error.message` to the console or a dedicated logging service for debugging.

## Low Priority Findings / Best Practices

### 8. Missing Security Headers (General)

*   **Files:** N/A (Server Configuration)
*   **Finding:** Standard security headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy` are likely missing (depend on server configuration).
*   **Risk:** Reduces defense-in-depth against clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, information leakage via referrers, and unwanted browser feature access.
*   **Recommendation:** Configure the web server or hosting platform to send these headers with appropriate values (e.g., `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`).

### 9. Autocomplete Enabled on Sensitive Form Fields

*   **Files:** `src/html/login.html`, `src/html/signup.html`
*   **Finding:** Password fields lack specific `autocomplete` attributes discouraging browser password saving.
*   **Risk:** Minor risk on shared computers if users allow browsers to save passwords.
*   **Recommendation:** Consider adding `autocomplete="new-password"` to signup password fields, `autocomplete="current-password"` to the login password field, and potentially `autocomplete="username"` or `autocomplete="off"` to email fields if desired.

### 10. Inline Styles and Scripts

*   **Files:** `src/html/*.html`
*   **Finding:** Use of inline `<style>` blocks and some inline `<script>` blocks.
*   **Risk:** Makes implementing a strict CSP without `'unsafe-inline'` more difficult.
*   **Recommendation:** Refactor inline styles/scripts into external files where practical. If inline code is necessary, use CSP nonces or hashes.

## Conclusion

The most urgent priority is to thoroughly review and strengthen the Supabase Row Level Security policies, as the exposed Anon key makes them the primary defense mechanism for the database. Addressing potential XSS vulnerabilities through consistent input sanitization and restricting the Google Maps API key are also high priorities. Implementing CSP, SRI, and other security headers will significantly improve the application's overall resilience.
