Okay, let's consolidate everything into a detailed report and an updated changelog.

Detailed Report: Securing Google Maps API Key for Pawsitive Strides

1. Project Context & Initial Problem:

Project: Pawsitive Strides - A web platform (Vanilla JS frontend, Supabase Backend-as-a-Service) connecting pet owners and dog walkers in India.

Core Feature: Uses Google Maps Platform APIs (Maps JavaScript, Geocoding, Places) for displaying user locations, finding nearby users, address input (Autocomplete), and location pinning.

Initial Security Vulnerability: The Google Maps API key was hardcoded directly into the client-side HTML files (profile.html, signup.html). This exposes the key publicly in the browser's source code.

Risks: Unauthorized use of the key by third parties leading to unexpected costs, hitting API usage quotas, and potential service disruption.

2. Goal:

To remove the hardcoded API key from the frontend source code and implement a more secure method for accessing the Google Maps APIs, while maintaining all existing map functionalities.

3. Explored Solutions & Chosen Approach:

Several methods were discussed:

Method 1: GCP API Key Restrictions (Essential): Limiting key usage via HTTP referrers and specific API restrictions in the Google Cloud Console.

Method 2: Environment Variables & Build Process: Storing the key outside source control and injecting it during build/deployment. (Still results in the key being in deployed client code).

Method 3: Backend Proxy Endpoint: Moving API calls to backend functions (Supabase Functions) that use the key securely stored server-side. (Most secure for data calls, but challenging for loading the map display script itself).

Method 4: Dynamic Loading via Backend Function (Chosen Approach - "Option C"): Storing the key securely server-side, creating a simple backend function to return the key only to authenticated users, and having the frontend JavaScript fetch this key then dynamically load the Google Maps script.

Reasoning for Choice: Option C provides a strong balance for this project structure. It keeps the key out of static client files, leverages Supabase Functions for a secure backend component, and allows the frontend to load the necessary Maps JavaScript API dynamically when needed. It's significantly more secure than hardcoding or fetching from a client-readable database table.

4. Implementation Steps Taken So Far:

GCP Restrictions Applied (Partially): HTTP referrer restrictions were configured in the Google Cloud Console to allow requests from local development environments (http://localhost:*, http://127.0.0.1:*). API restrictions were also set to limit the key to Maps JavaScript, Geocoding, and Places APIs. (Production domain restriction pending).

Supabase Secret Created (Google Key): The GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY was successfully added as a secure secret in the Supabase Project Settings -> Secrets.

Supabase Secret Attempted (Service Role Key): An attempt was made to add the Supabase service_role key as a secret named SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY. This failed due to the Supabase restriction preventing secrets from starting with the SUPABASE_ prefix.

Supabase Secret Created (Service Role Key - Corrected): Following guidance, the service_role key was successfully added as a secret named SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.

Supabase Edge Function Created (get-maps-key):

The basic function structure was created using supabase functions new get-maps-key.

The index.ts file was populated with TypeScript code designed to:

Handle CORS preflight requests.

Authenticate the incoming request using the user's JWT (Authorization header) and the SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.

Retrieve the GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY from Supabase secrets.

Return the API key in a JSON response to the authenticated client.

A shared _shared/cors.ts file was created with appropriate CORS headers, initially configured for the local development origin (http://127.0.0.1:5500).

VS Code Deno Environment Setup Attempted:

The official Deno VS Code extension (denoland.vscode-deno) was installed.

A .vscode/settings.json file was created within supabase/functions/ with the configuration { "deno.enable": true, "deno.lint": true, "deno.unstable": true }.

An initial syntax error in settings.json (incorrect type for deno.unstable) was identified.

5. Current Problem / Roadblock:

Despite installing the Deno extension and attempting to configure the workspace via .vscode/settings.json, the VS Code editor is not correctly recognizing the Deno runtime environment for the supabase/functions/get-maps-key/index.ts file.

Symptoms: Persistent TypeScript errors are shown in index.ts:

Cannot find module 'https://deno.land/std...'

Cannot find module 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js...'

Cannot find name 'Deno'.

Impact: This prevents effective local development and debugging of the Supabase function, as type checking, autocompletion, and module resolution are not working within the editor. The function cannot be reliably tested or finalized before deployment.

6. Desired Outcome & Next Steps:

Immediate Goal: Resolve the VS Code / Deno environment configuration issue so that index.ts is correctly interpreted as Deno code, eliminating the TypeScript errors.

Subsequent Goals:

Successfully deploy the get-maps-key Supabase Edge Function.

Implement the corresponding frontend changes in profile.html and profile.js to:

Remove the static Google Maps script tag.

Add the loadGoogleMapsApiKeyAndScript function to fetch the key from the deployed function.

Trigger this loading process appropriately (e.g., on dashboard load or map view click).

Ensure the existing map initialization logic (initMap, whenGoogleMapsReady, initializeMapRelatedFeatures) works correctly with the dynamically loaded script.

Thoroughly test the map functionality in the local development environment.

Update GCP referrer restrictions with the production domain upon deployment.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Implement Dynamic Google Maps API Key Loading (In Progress)

**Goal:** Enhance security by removing the hardcoded Google Maps API key from the client-side code and implementing a dynamic loading mechanism using a Supabase Edge Function.

**Reasoning:**
*   The previous method of hardcoding the API key in HTML (`profile.html`, `signup.html`) exposed it publicly, creating a security risk and potential for misuse.
*   This change moves the key to secure Supabase Secrets and uses a backend function to provide it only to authenticated users when needed by the frontend map features.

**Backend Changes (Attempted/In Progress):**
*   Added `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` as a secret in Supabase Project Settings -> Secrets.
*   Added the Supabase `service_role` key as a secret named `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (initial attempt with `SUPABASE_` prefix failed due to naming restrictions).
*   Created a new Supabase Edge Function named `get-maps-key`.
*   Implemented `supabase/functions/get-maps-key/index.ts` to:
    *   Handle CORS.
    *   Verify user authentication using the incoming JWT and the `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
    *   Read the `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` from secrets.
    *   Return the key in a JSON response.
*   Created `supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts` for CORS header configuration.

**Frontend Changes (Planned/Partial):**
*   **HTML (`profile.html`, `signup.html`):** The static `<script>` tag referencing the Google Maps API with the hardcoded key is to be **removed**.
*   **JavaScript (`profile.js`):**
    *   Added (or will add) a new async function `loadGoogleMapsApiKeyAndScript`.
    *   This function will:
        *   Fetch the API key from the `/functions/v1/get-maps-key` endpoint (sending the user's auth token).
        *   Dynamically create a `<script>` tag with the fetched key and necessary Google Maps API parameters (`callback`, `libraries`, etc.).
        *   Append the script tag to the document's `<head>`.
        *   Include error handling for the fetch and script loading process.
    *   Modified `initDashboard` (or relevant trigger) to call `loadGoogleMapsApiKeyAndScript` instead of assuming the API is loaded statically.
    *   Kept the existing global `initMap` function (called by Google's script) and the `whenGoogleMapsReady` helper mechanism to ensure map features initialize only after the API is loaded.

**Current Status / Issues:**
*   **Blocked:** Implementation is currently blocked by issues configuring the local VS Code development environment to correctly recognize the Deno runtime for the `get-maps-key/index.ts` file.
*   **Symptoms:** Persistent TypeScript errors (`Cannot find module`, `Cannot find name 'Deno'`) in `index.ts` prevent reliable function development and testing, despite installing the Deno VS Code extension and attempting configuration via `.vscode/settings.json`.
*   **Next Step:** Resolve the VS Code/Deno environment integration issue before proceeding with function deployment and frontend integration.

**Prerequisites (for this change):**
*   Supabase CLI installed and configured.
*   Deno VS Code Extension (`denoland.vscode-deno`) installed.

## [2024-05-03] - VS Code Deno Configuration Fixed

**Issue Resolution:** 
* Fixed VS Code configuration for Deno Edge Functions, resolving TypeScript validation errors.

**Technical Changes:**
* Modified both `.vscode/settings.json` (project root) and `supabase/functions/.vscode/settings.json` configuration files to properly support Deno Edge Functions.
* Changed `deno.unstable` setting from boolean to array format (`["libs"]`) to match the expected schema type in newer Deno extensions.
* Added appropriate `deno.codeLens.testArgs` array configuration.
* Created `supabase/functions/import_map.json` to simplify imports in Deno Edge Functions.
* Added local `supabase/functions/deno.jsonc` configuration to improve Deno integration.
* Set up proper module mapping for standard Deno libraries and Supabase client.

**Impact:**
* Resolved validation errors that were blocking local development and testing of the Edge Function.
* Enabled proper TypeScript IntelliSense and code completion for the `get-maps-key` Edge Function.
* Function imports now correctly use the import map with `import { serve } from 'std/http/server.ts'` format.

**Next Steps:**
* Complete the implementation of the Edge Function logic.
* Test the function's authentication and key retrieval capabilities.
* Deploy and integrate with frontend code as outlined in the original plan.
